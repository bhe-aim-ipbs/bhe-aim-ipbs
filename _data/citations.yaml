  description: "Federated learning (FL) has gained prominence in EEG-based emotion\
    \ recognition due to its ability to enable secure collaborative training without\
    \ centralized data. \nHowever, traditional FL faces challenges due to model and\
    \ data heterogeneity in smart healthcare settings. \nFor example, medical institutions\
    \ have varying computational resources, which creates a need for personalized\
    \ local models. \nMoreover, EEG data from medical institutions typically face\
    \ data heterogeneity issues stemming from limitations in participant availability,\
    \ ethical constraints, and cultural differences among subjects, which can slow\
    \ model convergence and degrade model performance. \nTo address these challenges,\
    \ we propose FedKDC, a novel FL framework that incorporates clustered knowledge\
    \ distillation (CKD). \nThis method introduces a consensus-based distributed learning\
    \ mechanism to facilitate the clustering process. \nIt then enhances the convergence\
    \ speed through intraclass distillation and reduces the negative impact of heterogeneity\
    \ through interclass distillation. \nAdditionally, we introduce a DriftGuard mechanism\
    \ to mitigate client drift, along with an entropy reducer to decrease the entropy\
    \ of aggregated knowledge. \nThe framework is validated on the SEED, SEED-IV,\
    \ SEED-FRA, and SEED-GER datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in scenarios\
    \ where both the data and the models are heterogeneous. \nExperimental results\
    \ show that FedKDC outperforms other FL frameworks in emotion recognition, achieving\
    \ a maximum average accuracy of 85.2%, and in convergence efficiency, with faster\
    \ and more stable convergence. \nOur code is made publicly available at: https://github.com/wdqdp/FedKDC.\n"
