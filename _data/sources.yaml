    Federated learning (FL) has gained prominence in EEG-based emotion recognition due to its ability to enable secure collaborative training without centralized data. 
    However, traditional FL faces challenges due to model and data heterogeneity in smart healthcare settings. 
    For example, medical institutions have varying computational resources, which creates a need for personalized local models. 
    Moreover, EEG data from medical institutions typically face data heterogeneity issues stemming from limitations in participant availability, ethical constraints, and cultural differences among subjects, which can slow model convergence and degrade model performance. 
    To address these challenges, we propose FedKDC, a novel FL framework that incorporates clustered knowledge distillation (CKD). 
    This method introduces a consensus-based distributed learning mechanism to facilitate the clustering process. 
    It then enhances the convergence speed through intraclass distillation and reduces the negative impact of heterogeneity through interclass distillation. 
    Additionally, we introduce a DriftGuard mechanism to mitigate client drift, along with an entropy reducer to decrease the entropy of aggregated knowledge. 
    The framework is validated on the SEED, SEED-IV, SEED-FRA, and SEED-GER datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in scenarios where both the data and the models are heterogeneous. 
    Experimental results show that FedKDC outperforms other FL frameworks in emotion recognition, achieving a maximum average accuracy of 85.2%, and in convergence efficiency, with faster and more stable convergence.

    Cardiovascular diseases are a prominent cause of mortality, emphasizing the need for early prevention and diagnosis. Utilizing artificial intelligence (AI) models, heart sound analysis emerges as a noninvasive and universally applicable approach for assessing cardiovascular health conditions. 
    However, real-world medical data are dispersed across medical institutions, forming “data islands” due to data sharing limitations for security reasons. 
    To this end, federated learning (FL) has been extensively employed in the medical field, which can effectively model across multiple institutions. 
    Additionally, conventional supervised classification methods require fully labeled data classes, e.g., binary classification requires labeling of positive and negative samples. 
    Nevertheless, the process of labeling healthcare data is time-consuming and labor-intensive, leading to the possibility of mislabeling negative samples. 
    In this study, we validate an FL framework with a naive positive-unlabeled (PU) learning strategy. Semisupervised FL model can directly learn from a limited set of positive samples and an extensive pool of unlabeled samples. 
    Our emphasis is on vertical-FL to enhance collaboration across institutions with different medical record feature spaces. 
    Additionally, our contribution extends to feature importance analysis, where we explore 6 methods and provide practical recommendations for detecting abnormal heart sounds. 
    The study demonstrated an impressive accuracy of 84%, comparable to outcomes in supervised learning, thereby advancing the application of FL in abnormal heart sound detection.

    Ubiquitous sensing has been widely applied in smart healthcare, providing an opportunity for intelligent heart sound auscultation. 
    However, smart devices contain sensitive information, raising user privacy concerns. 
    To this end, federated learning (FL) has been adopted as an effective solution, enabling decentralised learning without data sharing, thus preserving data privacy in the Internet of Health Things (IoHT). 
    Nevertheless, traditional FL requires the same architectural models to be trained across local clients and global servers, leading to a lack of model heterogeneity and client personalisation. 
    For medical institutions with private data clients, this study proposes Fed-MStacking, a heterogeneous FL framework that incorporates a stacking ensemble learning strategy to support clients in building their own models. 
    The secondary objective of this study is to address scenarios involving local clients with data characterised by inconsistent labelling. 
    Specifically, the local client contains only one case type, and the data cannot be shared within or outside the institution. 
    To train a global multi-class classifier, we aggregate missing class information from all clients at each institution and build meta-data, which then participates in FL training via a meta-learner. 
    We apply the proposed framework to a multi-institutional heart sound database. The experiments utilise random forests (RFs), feedforward neural networks (FNNs), and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) as base classifiers. 
    The results show that the heterogeneous stacking of local models performs better compared to homogeneous stacking.

    Objective: Early diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases is a crucial task in medical practice. 
    With the application of computer audition in the healthcare field, artificial intelligence (AI) has been applied to clinical non-invasive intelligent auscultation of heart sounds to provide rapid and effective pre-screening. 
    However, AI models generally require large amounts of data which may cause privacy issues. Unfortunately, it is difficult to collect large amounts of healthcare data from a single centre. 
    Methods: In this study, we propose federated learning (FL) optimisation strategies for the practical application in multi-centre institutional heart sound databases. 
    The horizontal FL is mainly employed to tackle the privacy problem by aligning the feature spaces of FL participating institutions without information leakage. 
    In addition, techniques based on deep learning have poor interpretability due to their “black-box” property, which limits the feasibility of AI in real medical data. 
    To this end, vertical FL is utilised to address the issues of model interpretability and data scarcity. 
    Conclusion: Experimental results demonstrate that, the proposed FL framework can achieve good performance for heart sound abnormality detection by taking the personal privacy protection into account. 
    Moreover, using the federated feature space is beneficial to balance the interpretability of the vertical FL and the privacy of the data. 
    Significance: This work realises the potential of FL from research to clinical practice, and is expected to have extensive application in the federated smart medical system.
